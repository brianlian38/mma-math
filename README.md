MMA Math: A hilarious and largely useless way to prove one fighter is better than another - despite never facing each other. It's the logic that states if Fighter A beats Fighter B, and Fighter B beats Fighter C, Fighter A will beat Fighter C.

 ... Don't take my word for it, take legendary fighter [Chael Sonnen's take](https://youtu.be/S-iSA59DWdk?t=75) "MMA math largely works, if you beat a guy and that guy beats a guy, you're likely to beat that other guy!"
 
# Instructions
- Enter 2 Fighters
- Get a chain connecting them through mutual opponents
- Find the mma math proved argument that the first fighter beats the second.

Inspired by [Tanner Baldus's](https://github.com/TannerBaldus) original mma math site, I embarked on my own spin on the project - mainly to burn up some free time during a less busy period of school and shake off the rust on some coding skills
